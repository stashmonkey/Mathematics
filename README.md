# Mathematics
Common and uncommon mathematical equations (high school), automated by the power of c programming.
This repository was made mainly in the sense of having a safe space to store the code I would have 
written. I use a really volatile chromebook so github is the only place I can publish/store my code 
(not the whole of it). So this repository was made because I wanted to automate some of the mathematical (geometric)
paradigms I study in school like the distance formulae, the pythagorean theorem etc... It may seem 
petty but I use these paradigms an alwful lot so the best I thought I coud do was to use the craft of c programming 
and write some of these programs so that I could have an extent of saving time in my studies. So whether you 
are a high schooler, like me or just scrolling on github just feel free to try them out and please update me 
on how I can make these programms better. 

# Installation Guide 

- You need to clone the repository and compile it using your favourite compiler (mine is gcc).
- You may need to link some of the included header files externally like

     gcc dist.c -o dist -lm

- Do not forget the linking command because if you forget chances are you will get
  an error like (implicit declaration of ___), all depending on the used functions.

# Goodbye 

So in the end all I want to say is have fun and please if you encounter any error feel free 
to contact me and I will try my best to help you fix them.
